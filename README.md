# Love Calculator

## Overview
The Love Calculator is a simple Python script that computes a love score between two people based on their names. The script combines the names, counts the occurrences of letters in the words "TRUE" and "LOVE", and generates a love score which is then used to display a personalized message.

## How It Works

Input: The user is prompted to enter two names.

Calculation:
The names are combined and converted to lowercase.
The script counts the occurrences of the letters in "TRUE" and "LOVE" in the combined string.
These counts are concatenated to form a two-digit love score.

Output: A message is displayed based on the love score.

## Love Score Interpretation

Score < 10 or > 90: "Your score is X, you go together like coke and mentos."

Score between 40 and 50: "Your score is X, you are alright together."

Other Scores: "Your score is X."
